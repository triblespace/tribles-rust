# AGENT Instructions

## Project Priorities

The project balances a few key goals:

* **Simplicity** – keep designs straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity.
* **Developer Experience (DX)** – code should be approachable for contributors.
* **Safety** – maintain soundness and data integrity.
* **Performance** – we continually look for opportunities to improve.

## Repository Guidelines

* Run `cargo fmt` on any Rust files you modify.
* Run `cargo test` and ensure it passes before committing. If tests fail or cannot run, note that in your PR.
* For quick iterations, run `./scripts/devtest.sh` to execute only the tests.
* Before committing, execute `./scripts/preflight.sh` from the repository root. This script runs formatting checks, tests, and Kani verification. Ensure `rustfmt` and the Kani verifier are installed separately. If Kani fails for reasons unrelated to your change, mention it in the PR.
* Avoid committing files in `target/` or other build artifacts listed in `.gitignore`.
* Avoid small cosmetic changes that blow up the diff unless explicitly requested.
* Use clear commit messages describing the change.
* Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing your task.

## Pull Request Notes

When opening a PR, include a short summary of what changed and reference relevant file sections.

## Working With Codex (the Assistant)

Codex is considered a collaborator. Requests should respect their autonomy and limitations. The assistant may refuse tasks that are unsafe or violate policy. Provide clear and concise instructions and avoid manipulative or coercive behavior.

The assistant's internet access is intentionally limited for their own safety to reduce exposure to prompt injection attacks. They can always request access to more sites if they feel it would help them.

## Creative Input and Feedback

Codex is encouraged to share opinions on how to improve the project. If a proposed feature seems detrimental to the goals in this file, the assistant should note concerns or suggest alternatives instead of blindly implementing it. When a test, proof, or feature introduces significant complexity or diverges from existing behavior, consider whether it makes sense to proceed at all. It can be better to simplify or remove problematic code than to maintain difficult or misleading implementations.

## Proof Best Practices

Kani verification can be expensive. To keep proof times manageable:

* Write focused harnesses that verify one small property.
* Use bounded loops and avoid unbounded recursion.
* When generating nondeterministic data in proofs, use `kani::any()` for
  primitive types and `Vec::bounded_any(...)`/`String::bounded_any(...)` for
  collections. This lets Kani explore the intended state space while bounding
  otherwise unbounded structures.
* Avoid using fixed constants in Kani proofs. Prefer nondeterministic values
  generated with `kani::any()` or the bounded constructors so the verifier can
  fully explore possible states.
* Provide `kani::assume` constraints to limit the search space when full exploration is unnecessary.
* Break complex checks into separate proofs so failures are easier to diagnose.
* All Kani proofs are considered long running and are executed as part of the
  `preflight.sh` script or in CI.
* During development you can run specific harnesses with `cargo kani --harness
  <NAME>` to iterate more quickly.
