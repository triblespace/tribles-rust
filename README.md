# About

> “Insufficient facts always invite danger.”  
> — *Mr. Spock*

**Trible Space** is a data space and knowledge graph standard. It offers metadata management capabilities similar to file- and version-control systems, combined with the queryability and convenience of an embedded database, tailored towards use with simple blob storage. It is designed to be a holistic yet lightweight data storage solution that can be used in a variety of contexts, from embedded systems to distributed cloud services.

Our goal is to re-invent data storage from first principles and overcome the shortcomings of prior "Semantic Web"/triple-store technologies. By focusing on simplicity, canonical data formats, cryptographic identifiers, and clean distributed semantics, we aim to provide a lean, lightweight yet powerful toolkit for knowledge representation, database management, and data exchange use cases.

## Features

- **Lean, Lightweight & Flexible**: Data storage seamlessly scales from in-memory data organization to large-scale blob and metadata storage on S3 like services.
- **Distributed**: Eventually consistent CRDT semantics (based on the CALM principle), compressed zero-copy archives, and built-in version control.
- **Predictable Performance**: An optimizer-free design using novel algorithms and data structures removes the need for manual query-tuning and enables single-digit microsecond latency.  
- **Fast In-Memory Datasets**: Enjoy cheap copy-on-write (COW) semantics and speedy set operations, allowing you to treat entire datasets as values.
- **Compile-Time Typed Queries**: Automatic type inference, type-checking, and auto-completion make writing queries a breeze. You can even create queries that span multiple datasets and native Rust data structures.
- **Low Overall Complexity**: We aim for a design that feels obvious (in the best way) and makes good use of existing language facilities. A serverless design makes it completely self-sufficient for local use and requires only an S3-compatible service for distribution.
- **Easy Implementation**: The spec is designed to be friendly to high- and low-level languages, or even hardware implementations.
- **Lock-Free Blob Writes**: Blob data is appended with a single `O_APPEND` write. Each handle advances an in-memory `applied_length` only if no other writer has appended in between, scanning any gap to ingest missing records. Concurrent writers may duplicate blobs, but hashes guarantee consistency. Updating branch heads uses a short `flush → refresh → lock → refresh → append → unlock` sequence.
- **Coordinated Refresh**: `refresh` acquires a shared file lock while scanning to avoid races with `restore` truncating the pile.

## Getting Started

Add the crate to your project:

```bash
cargo add triblespace
```

Once the crate is installed, you can experiment immediately with the
quick-start program below. It showcases the attribute macros, workspace
staging, queries, and pushing commits to a repository.

```rust
use ed25519_dalek::SigningKey;
use rand::rngs::OsRng;
use triblespace::prelude::*;
use triblespace::prelude::blobschemas::LongString;
use triblespace::core::repo::{memoryrepo::MemoryRepo, Repository};

mod literature {
    use triblespace::prelude::*;
    use triblespace::prelude::blobschemas::LongString;
    use triblespace::prelude::valueschemas::{Blake3, GenId, Handle, R256, ShortString};

    attributes! {

        "A74AA63539354CDA47F387A4C3A8D54C" as pub title: ShortString;

        /// A quote from a work.

        "0DBB530B37B966D137C50B943700EDB2" as pub firstname: ShortString;

        "6BAA463FD4EAF45F6A103DB9433E4545" as pub lastname: ShortString;

        "FCCE870BECA333D059D5CD68C43B98F0" as pub page_count: R256;
