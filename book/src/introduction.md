# Introduction

Welcome to the **Tribles Book**. This guide provides a gentle introduction to
Trible Space, its design goals and how to use the `tribles` crate.  The aim is to
present a clear narrative for newcomers while linking to inâ€‘depth reference
material for those who want to dig deeper.

Trible Space combines ideas from databases and version control. Data is stored
in small immutable blobs that can live in memory, on disk or inside remote
object stores without conversion. Cryptographic identifiers ensure integrity and
enable efficient sharing across systems.

While this book walks you through the basics, the crate documentation offers a
complete API reference. Use the links throughout the text to jump directly to
the modules that interest you. A [Glossary](glossary.md) is provided for quick
reference to common terms.

If you would like to work on Tribles yourself, check out [Developing Locally](contributing.md).
