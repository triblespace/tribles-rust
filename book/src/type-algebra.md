# The Type Algebra of TribleSpace

## Queries as Types, Data as Proofs

TribleSpace grew out of a pragmatic goal: keep data declarative, composable, and statically checkable in Rust.
Along the way we discovered that the core operations already form a **type algebra**.
The macros used to define attributes, entities, and queries map directly onto familiar type-theoretic constructions, yielding an isomorphism between *relations over triples* and *types over records*.

## Attributes Introduce Atomic Types

Each attribute introduced with `attributes!` defines an **atomic type** — a unary relation between an entity identifier and the attribute’s value:

```text
"A74AA..." as pub title : ShortString
```

Formally this is a function `title : Id → ValueTitle`, or, in relational terms, the set `{ (id, value) }`.
In the codebase the macro emits a `pub const` of type [`Attribute<S>`](../src/attribute.rs), so the generated binding already carries the `ValueSchema` that governs the value column.
These atomic pieces are the building blocks for everything else.

## Entities as Intersection Types

An `entity!` expression forms a **record type** by intersecting atomic ones.
Semantically it is the meet (`∧`) of its constituent relations:

```text
Entity{A, B}  ≡  { A : ValueA } ∧ { B : ValueB }
```

At runtime `entity!` expands to a small [`TribleSet`](../src/trible/tribleset.rs) containing those facts; the procedural macro literally emits a fresh set, populates it with [`Trible::new`][Trible] calls, and returns the set by value.
At the type level it represents their conjunction.
Records are therefore intersection types: every additional field refines the shape without invalidating existing data.

## Merge Drives Dataset Composition

The `+=` operator delegates to [`TribleSet::union`](../src/trible/tribleset.rs), exposed through the `AddAssign` implementation.
`union` performs **set union** on the six internal indexes that back a `TribleSet`.
When the entity identifiers are disjoint the effect is classic dataset union; when they coincide we get field conjunction—record extension.
This dual role is what keeps TribleSpace’s algebra compact.

### One Operator, Two Readings

Everything that looks like “add another field” or “add another record” derives from the single law

```text
union(facts₁, facts₂) = facts₁ ∪ facts₂.
```

The surrounding context determines how to read the result:

| Context        | Effect        | Algebraic Face        |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| same entity ID | extend record | ∧ (field conjunction) |
| different IDs  | add record    | ∨ (set union)         |

The behaviour follows from the idempotent, commutative nature of `TribleSet::union`; no special cases are required in the implementation.

## Patterns as Row-Type Predicates

A `find!`/`pattern!` pair behaves like a **row-type predicate**:

```text
pattern!([A, B])  ≈  ∀r. {A, B} ⊆ r.
```

Read this as “find every entity whose row type `r` is a supertype of this shape.”
The macro expands to an [`IntersectionConstraint`](../src/query/intersectionconstraint.rs) built from [`TriblePattern`](../src/query.rs) constraints, so queries literally evaluate the conjunction of the row predicates.

Patterns compose intersectionally as well: combining two patterns is equivalent to requiring both row predicates simultaneously, mirroring intersection types at the query level.

## The Lattice Perspective

`TribleSet`s form a **join-semilattice** under `union`:

```
union(a, b) = a ∪ b
a ≤ b  ⇔  a ⊆ b.
```

Projection, join, and filtering are lattice homomorphisms: they preserve joins and the partial order.
Because the same algebra handles both data and metadata, the implementation remains uniform and performant—merging facts is always the same low-level operation.

## Practical Payoffs

Seeing the primitives through a type-theoretic lens clarifies several ergonomic choices:

- **Queries as proofs.** Successful `find!` rows witness that an entity inhabits the requested type; absence is simply failure to prove the predicate.
- **Descriptive schemas.** Structural typing drops the need for globally declared records—the type system is implicit in the patterns you write.
- **Composable extensions.** Adding new attributes is monotonic: existing entities continue to satisfy prior predicates, and refined queries simply intersect more row constraints.

## Summary Table

| Level          | Concept           | Operation        |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Attribute      | atomic type       | unary relation   |
| Entity         | conjunction       | record formation |
| Dataset        | union             | set composition  |
| Query          | sub-row predicate | type constraint  |
| Implementation | lattice union     | `∪`              |

With a single associative, commutative, idempotent union, we obtain both row extension and dataset union, and a unified logical framework that bridges *data engineering* with *type theory*.
That economy of primitives allows the system to feel simple on the surface yet provide rich type theory underneath.
