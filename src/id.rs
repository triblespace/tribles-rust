//! [RawId]/[OwnedId] are 128bit high-entropy persistent identifiers.
//!
//! # General Remarks on Identifiers
//! We found it useful to split identifiers into three categories:
//! - human readable names (e.g. attribute names, head labels, e.t.c)
//!   
//!   These should be used deliberately and be bounded by a context:
//!   attribute names for example are contextualized by a namespace;
//!   heads are bound to a system environment.
//! - persistent identifiers (e.g. UUIDs, UFOIDs, RNGIDs)
//!   
//!   These opaquely address an identity with associated content that is
//!   changing, extensible or yet undetermined.
//!   While this might seem similar to a human readable names,
//!   it is important that they do not have any semantic meaning
//!   or cultural connotation.
//!   They must be cheaply generatable/mintable without any coordination,
//!   while being globally valid and unique.[^1]
//! - content addressed identifiers (e.g. hashes or signatures)
//!   
//!   Are essentially a unique fingerprint of the identified information.
//!   They not only allow two seperate entities to agree on the same identifier
//!   without any coordination, but also allow for easy content validation.
//!   They are the identifier of choice for any kind of immutable data (e.g. triblesets, blobs),
//!   and should be combined with the other identifiers even in mutable cases.
//!
//! To give an example from the world of scientific publishing.
//! Ideally published paper artefacts (e.g. .html and .pdf files) would
//! be identified and _referenced/cited_ by their hash.
//! Each published artifact/version should contain a persistent identifier
//! allowing the different versions to be tied together as one logical paper.
//! The abbreviations that a paper uses for its citations and bibliography
//! are then an example of a human readable name scoped to that paper.
//!
//! # Consistency, Directed Edges and Owned IDs
//!
//! While a simple grow set already constitutes a CRDT, it is also limited in
//! expressiveness. To provide richer semantics while guaranteeing conflict-free
//! mergeability we allow only "owned" IDs to be used in the `entity` position
//! of newly generated triples. As owned IDs are [send] but not [sync] owning a
//! set of them essentially constitutes a single writer transaction domain,
//! allowing for some non-monotonic operations like `if-does-not-exist`, over
//! the set of contained entities. Note that this does not make operations that
//! would break CALM safe, e.g. `delete`.
//!
//! A different perspective is that edges are always ordered from describing
//! to described entities, with circles constituting consensus between entities.
//!
//!
//!
//! # High-entropy persistent identifiers
//!
//! The only approach to generate persistent identifiers in a distributed setting
//! (i.e. without coordinating authority), is to give them enough entropy that
//! they
//! A valid concern one might have is
//! They have no predictability and are extremely resistant to
//! random bit errors. However this comes at the cost of no locality and
//! compressability.
//!
//!
//! |                | rngid | ufoid | fucid |
//! |----------------|-------|-------|-------|
//! | entropy        | high  | high  | low   |
//! | locality       | none  | high  | high  |
//! | compression    | none  | low   | high  |
//! | predictability | none  | low   | mid   |
//!
//! ## RNGID / Random Number Generator ID
//! Are generated by simply taking 128bits from a cryptographic random
//! source. They are easy to implement and provide the maximum possible amount
//! of entropy at the cost of locality and compressability. However UFOIDs are
//! almost universally a better choice, unless the use-case is incompatible with
//! leaking the time at which an id was minted.
//!
//!
//! ## UFOID / Universal Forgettable Ordered IDs
//! Are generated by concatenaing a rolling 32bit millisecond timestamp with
//! 96bits of cryptographic randomness. This provides high locality for ufoids
//! minted in close temporal proximity, and it provides fast and simple
//! identification of "old" ids in contexts where high data generation requires
//! regular garbage collection of stale information (e.g. robotics).
//! A range of 2^32 milliseconds corresponds to a rolling window of ~50 days,
//! which should be wide enough for most high-volume use cases, while still
//! providing sufficient bits of high-quality entropy. Having a practically
//! relevant rollover rate, also ensures that this edge case is accounted for
//! and tested, compared to schemes which place the burden of dealing with
//! overflows on future generations.
//!
//!
//! ## FUCID / Fast Unsafe Compressible IDs
//! Are generated by XORing a 128bit `salt` with a 128bit incrementing integer.
//! The salt is unique for each source generating fucids (i.e. each thread),
//! and initialized with 128bits of cryptographic randomness.
//! This creates a pseudo-random exhaustive walk through the 128bit space,
//! while maintaining high per-source locality.
//! It might seem counter intuitive that an identifier with low entropy
//! can still be used in a distributed setting. Note however fucids only have
//! low entropy between each other when they are from the same source (thread).
//! This makes them succeptible to collisions due to hardware errors (bit-flips),
//! but they still retain high global uniqueness without coordination.
//! E.g. in a scenario where every source only generates a single fucid the
//! scheme degenerates to the rngid scheme.
//!
//!
//! [^1]: An reader familiar with digital/academic publishing might recognize
//! that DOIs do not fit these criteria. In fact they combine the worst of
//! both worlds as non-readable human-readable names with semantic information
//! about the minting organisation.
