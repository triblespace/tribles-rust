//! Query facilities for matching tribles by declaring patterns of constraints.
//! Build queries with the [`find!`](crate::prelude::find) macro which binds variables and
//! combines constraint expressions:
//!
//! ```
//! # use triblespace_core::prelude::*;
//! # use triblespace_core::prelude::valueschemas::ShortString;
//! let results = find!((x: Value<ShortString>), x.is("foo".to_value())).collect::<Vec<_>>();
//! ```

//! For a tour of the language see the "Query Language" chapter in the book.
//! Conceptual background on schemas and join strategy appears in the
//! "Query Engine" and "Atreides Join" chapters.

/// The `find!` macro is a convenient way to declare variables and concrete types for them.
/// It also sets up the nessecairy context for higher-level query languages like the one
/// provided by the [crate::namespace] module, by injecting a `_local_find_context!` macro
/// that provides a reference to the current variable context. [^note]
///
/// [^note]: This is a bit of a hack to simulate dynamic scoping, which is not possible in Rust.
/// But it allows for a more ergonomic query language syntax that does not require the user
/// to manually pass around the variable context.
///
/// The `find!` macro takes two arguments:
/// - A tuple of variables and their concrete result types, e.g., `(a: Value<ShortString>, b: Ratio)`.
/// - A constraint that describes the pattern you are looking for, e.g., `and!(a.is("Hello World!"), b.is(42))`.
///
/// Note that concrete type declarations for variables, e.g., `a: Value<ShortString>`, `a: String`, or `a: _`,
/// are optional, and can be omitted if the type can be inferred from context.
/// Variable schema types are automatically inferred from the constraint, if possible.
/// The query will automatically perform the necessary conversions between the schema types
/// and the concrete types of the variables. If the conversion fails, the query will panic.
/// For more control over the conversion, you can use a `Value<_>` type for the variable, and use
/// the `TryFromValue` trait to convert the values manually and handle the errors explicitly.
///
/// The macro expands to a call to the [Query::new] constructor, which takes the variables and the constraint
/// as arguments, and returns a [Query] object that can be used to iterate over the results of the query.
///
/// The macro also injects a `_local_find_context!` macro that provides a reference to the current variable context.
/// This allows for macros in query languages, like [pattern!](crate::namespace),
/// to declare new variables in the same scope as the `find!` macro.
/// But you should not use the `_local_find_context!` macro directly,
/// unless you are implementing a custom query language.
